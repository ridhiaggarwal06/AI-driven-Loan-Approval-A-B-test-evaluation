# AI-driven-Loan-Approval-A-B-test-evaluation

To address high error rates in its existing AI-assisted loan approval system—resulting in financial losses and missed customer opportunities—a lending company introduced a new AI model. 
The objective was to evaluate whether this model could reduce Type I (false rejections) and Type II (false approvals) errors and support better decision-making by loan officers. 
A 10-day randomized A/B test involving 47 loan officers was conducted. The analysis used Welch’s t-tests and effect size calculations to compare error rates, decision alignment with AI recommendations, conflicts, and confidence levels between the control and treatment groups. Custom metrics were also engineered to quantify changes in behavior and decision patterns.

The results showed a significant reduction in both error types: Type I errors decreased by 44.9% and Type II errors by 31.7% in the treatment group. 
Cohen’s d values above 1.7 confirmed large practical effect sizes. Officers in the treatment group showed increased alignment with AI recommendations and fewer conflicting decisions, while confidence levels remained stable. 
These findings demonstrated both statistical and practical improvements, supporting the AI model’s effectiveness in enhancing real-world lending decisions.
