## Strategic Evaluation of an AI-Driven Credit Risk Model
---

### 1. Recovering Lost Revenue from Rejected Applicants

#### Finding:
The AI model significantly reduced cases where creditworthy applicants were wrongly rejected, approving nearly 45% more “good” customers than the existing system.

#### Why it mattered:
This showed clear revenue upside without increasing customer acquisition costs. For a growing startup, this highlighted a practical way to scale the loan book by capturing customers who were previously being turned away despite being low risk.

### 2. Reducing Financial Risk and Loan Defaults

#### Finding:
The AI model also approved far fewer high-risk loans, cutting bad approvals by around 32% compared to the legacy process.

#### Why it mattered:
This demonstrated that the model could meaningfully reduce default risk and protect capital. The findings helped frame how AI could improve portfolio health and support long-term sustainability, which is especially important for maintaining investor confidence.

### 3. Evaluating How Humans Actually Use AI Recommendations

#### Finding:
Loan officers followed AI recommendations more closely over time, even though their personal confidence levels did not increase.

#### Why it mattered:
This surfaced an important behavioural insight: while the AI was influencing decisions, trust in the system had not fully developed. This pointed to the need for better training or explainability, ensuring the technology is integrated thoughtfully rather than blindly adopted.

### 4. Deciding Whether the Model Was Ready to Launch

#### Finding:
Although early results were promising, the data showed high variability due to the short testing window.

#### Why it mattered:
Instead of pushing for immediate rollout, I recommended extending the experiment by a few weeks. This helped avoid premature decisions based on unstable trends and demonstrated a risk-aware approach to deploying AI in a live business environment.
