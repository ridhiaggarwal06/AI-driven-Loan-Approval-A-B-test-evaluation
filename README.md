# AI-driven-Loan-Approval-A-B-test-evaluation

Situation:
A lending company faced high error rates in its existing AI-assisted loan approval system, risking financial loss and missed customer opportunities.

Task:
Evaluate whether a new AI model could reduce Type I and Type II errors and improve loan officer decision-making.

Action:
Conducted a 10-day randomized A/B test with 47 officers. Performed Welch’s t-tests and calculated effect sizes to compare error rates, agreement with AI, conflicts, and confidence shifts between control and treatment groups. Custom metrics were engineered to quantify behavioral changes.

Result:
The new model significantly reduced Type I errors by 44.9% and Type II errors by 31.7%, both with large effect sizes (Cohen’s d > 1.7). It increased alignment with AI recommendations and decreased decision conflicts, while maintaining officer confidence. Findings demonstrated both statistical and practical impact, supporting real-world deployment.
